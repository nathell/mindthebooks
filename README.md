# Mind the Books

## The Story

I was living in London between 2011 and 2014. During that time, I became a member of a number of libraries in various London boroughs. I borrowed a lot of books, and more often than not, I was forgetting to renew them or return them on time. This cost me quite a lot of money, with accrued fees well in excess of Â£70. It was then that I got an idea of writing a simple web application that would just sit there and renew your books automatically, so you don't have to remember this.

Due to free time being a sparse resource, I never got around to doing it. Until now.

I'm on a sabbatical these days, and I've applied for a next job as a Ruby programmer. My Ruby skills are rusty and I have never done anything in Rails, so at the interview [they] said, let's see how quickly you can learn Rails. So I said, let me do MTB. They said, go ahead!

So here it is, my repo for all the world to see. Not that anyone would notice, but if someone does, with a bit of luck it can even be usable in a week or two.
